<b>Enterprise Application with MySQL, Java Spring Boot, and React </b><br />
Welcome to our Enterprise Application project! This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of MySQL database with Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for the frontend. We've implemented essential functionalities needed for enterprise applications, including CRUD operations, report generation in PDF and Excel formats, sorting, and search capabilities.

<b>CRUD Operations:</b> Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on your enterprise data.<br />
<b>Report Generation:</b> Generate reports in both PDF and Excel formats for easy data analysis.<br />
<b>Sorting:</b> Sort data by column titles to quickly find the information you need.<br />
<b>Search Ability:</b> Search through your data efficiently with our search functionality.<br /><br />
<b>Technologies Used</b>
<b>MySQL:<b/> A robust relational database management system for storing your enterprise data.<br />
<b>Java Spring Boot:</b> A powerful framework for building Java-based enterprise applications, providing features such as dependency injection, RESTful web services, and more.<br />
<b>React:</b> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering a component-based approach for creating interactive UIs.<br />
